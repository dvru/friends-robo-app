Redux:
- Good for Managing large state
- Useful for sharing data between containers
- Predictable state management using the 3 principles

The 3 Principles:
- Single sourse of truth
- State is read only
- Changes using pure functions

Action:
Something that the users does:
ex: clicking a button, or drop down menu
As soon as a User clicks on the button and creates an Action
it goes through the Reducer.
Reducer: 
Is a pure function that receives an input which is the action, 
and creates an output which is the state; store
Store:
Which is the entire state of the app.
As it goes through the reducer(function), the store gets updated,
and react notices a change and 
Makes Changes: to the view
